question,answer
What frontier AI models has Alex Covo worked with?,"He has hands‑on experience with OpenAI GPT‑4o, Anthropic Claude 4, and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, selecting each based on latency, context length, and reasoning depth."
Which local language models does Alex deploy on‑prem?,"Qwen3, Llama 4, Mistral, Gemma, Phi‑4, and DeepSeek—served via Ollama, LM Studio, or Apple MLX for private, low‑latency inference."
How does Alex orchestrate local LLM servers?,"Using Ollama’s container‑style model management and LM Studio’s GUI inspector, plus shell scripts to automate hot‑swapping of GGUF weights."
What prompting techniques does Alex specialize in?,"Layered system prompts, explicit role instructions, and Deep‑Research chains that cue models to verify claims with cited sources."
Which agentic frameworks has Alex mastered?,CrewAI for multi‑agent orchestration and Pipecat for voice‑driven agents combining STT and TTS modules.
Describe Alex’s experience with Retrieval‑Augmented Generation.,"He designs MCP‑based pipelines where queries embed, retrieve Supabase or MySQL vectors, then re‑inject context into the LLM for grounded responses."
What coding‑centric AI IDEs does Alex use?,"Cursor and Windsurf, enabling inline agent suggestions, refactors, and docstring generation."
Is Alex a programmer?,"He isn’t hired as a developer, but his working knowledge of Python, JavaScript, and Next.js lets him collaborate effectively with engineering teams."
Which TTS/STT engines has Alex integrated?,"ElevenLabs, Kokoro, Deepgram, Whisper, and Coqui TTS—often wrapped with Pipecat for local privacy‑first voice workflows."
How does Alex fine‑tune models?,"He employs Transformer Lab or Unsloth LoRA adapters on his RTX workstation, followed by eval using MT‑Bench‑lite."
What generative 3D tools are in Alex’s toolkit?,Luma AI for NeRF captures and Kaedim for text‑to‑mesh asset creation.
Which video and image generators does Alex prefer?,"Runway Gen‑2, Adobe Firefly, DALL‑E 3, Canva Magic Design, Stable Diffusion, and Kaiber for stylized motion graphics."
How does Alex integrate MoCap into his pipeline?,Move AI’s markerless captures feed FBX animations into Blender or Unreal scenes.
What traditional Adobe tools does Alex still rely on?,"Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects—now augmented by AI features like generative fill and text‑based editing."
Does Alex use standard business software?,"Yes—Word and Excel for documentation and budgeting, often enhanced with AI plugins for summarization and formula generation."
What database solutions has Alex deployed?,Legacy MySQL for transactional data and Supabase (Postgres + edge functions) for modern AI‑augmented apps.
Explain Alex’s use of the MCP protocol.,"The Modular Context Protocol structures prompt, embedding, and metadata payloads so micro‑services can pass LLM context cleanly."
How does Alex track AI tool evolution?,"CrewAI agents scrape Hugging Face and arXiv daily, summarizing breakthroughs into a Slack digest."
Why does Alex favor open‑source AI?,"Control over weights, transparency in training data, and compliance with client privacy requirements."
Give an example of Alex combining multiple AI tools in one project.,"For an automated fashion blog: Gemini Flash drafts copy, a local Llama 4 agent fact‑checks, Runway generates header videos, and Supabase stores posts—all orchestrated via CrewAI."
