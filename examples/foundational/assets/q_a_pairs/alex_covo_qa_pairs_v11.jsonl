I treat every challenge as a transformation opportunity and create environments where people feel supported and capable."}
{"question": "How do you motivate creative teams while aligning them with business goals?", "answer": "By creating a culture of respect and flexibility, I align personal growth with business outcomes. I ensure team members feel valued and understand that their development is part of the strategic plan. Open communication around learning, feedback, and long-term opportunities keeps people engaged, which naturally drives results."}
{"question": "Tell me about a difficult decision you made that impacted your team.", "answer": "I once had to leave a team I had built from the ground up. I had prepared them to be self-sufficient, ensuring leadership wasn\u2019t about me but about shared ownership. The transition was smooth because they were empowered and aligned with the mission. My departure became a growth opportunity for them, which reflected the strength of the structure we created."}
{"question": "What is your leadership style and how has it evolved?", "answer": "I observe, listen, and think critically. I believe in building systems that minimize friction, using soft skills, emotional intelligence, and scenario-based reasoning. My management style is built on wisdom, not ego. With AI, I now use scenario modeling and predictive outcomes to enhance my decision-making and elevate the team\u2019s performance."}
{"question": "How do you handle conflict or underperformance on your team?", "answer": "I approach conflict by identifying root causes. Performance metrics are not always accurate, so I assess if people are in the right roles. Often, underperformance stems from mismatches or unclear expectations. I move people into roles that align with their strengths. I don\u2019t take sides\u2014just find the best outcome for the person and the team."}
{"question": "How do you balance creative vision with business constraints?", "answer": "Balancing vision with reality is a core skill. I involve stakeholders early, align creative ideas with business objectives, and guide clients through constraints with transparency and empathy. I protect the integrity of the creative process while building trust and consensus."}
{"question": "Describe your process for developing a project strategy.", "answer": "I start by listening\u2014understanding goals, constraints, stakeholders, and business context. From there, I scale down the vision to match timelines and resources. I leverage AI for research, market trends, scenario planning, and ideation. Using CrewAI and agentic frameworks, I can build a 360-degree strategic process faster and more effectively."}
{"question": "How do you stay ahead of industry trends?", "answer": "I\u2019ve consistently embraced emerging technologies\u2014from the internet and multimedia in the \u201990s to generative AI today. I study deeply, stay curious, and test innovations early. My mindset is rooted in the Socratic method: I know that I know nothing. That humility drives constant learning."}
{"question": "What metrics do you use to measure success in a campaign?", "answer": "Success depends on context\u2014sometimes it's ROI, other times it\u2019s brand engagement, reach, or client satisfaction. But equally important is internal team cohesion and how the experience sets the team and client up for future success."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time you turned around a failing project.", "answer": "At ParishPay/Intuition, I helped turn around a failing startup with poor UX and client satisfaction. I realigned the overseas tech team, rebuilt the UI/UX, trained internal teams on customer success, and redesigned onboarding. Eventually, the company was acquired successfully, delivering value to the stakeholders."}
