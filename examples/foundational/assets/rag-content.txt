- Privacy by Design: All data remains on the user's device. No data is sold, shared, or sent to the cloud. It is ideal for families, educators, medical professionals, or anyone valuing privacy.
- Potential Applications: It can be adapted as a private home-schooling tutor, a secure medical Q&A assistant, or a creative brainstorming partner, all while keeping data private.
