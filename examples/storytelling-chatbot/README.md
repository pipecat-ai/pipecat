# Storytelling Chatbot

<img src="image.png" width="420px">

This example shows how to build a voice-driven interactive storytelling experience.
It periodically prompts the user for input for a 'choose your own adventure' style experience.

We add visual elements to the story by generating images at lightning speed using Fal.

### It uses the following AI services:

**Deepgram - Speech-to-Text**

Transcribes inbound participant voice media to text.

**OpenAI (GPT4) - LLM**

Our creative writer LLM. You can see the context used to prompt it [here](src/prompts.py)

**ElevenLabs - Text-to-Speech**

Converts and streams the LLM response from text to audio

**Fal.ai - Image Generation**

Adds pictures to our story (really fast!) Prompting is quite key for style consistency, so we task the LLM to turn each story page into a short image prompt.

## Setup

**Install requirements**

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Create environment file and set variables:**

```shell
mv env.example .env
```

When deploying to production, to ensure only this app can spawn a new bot, set your `ENV` to `production`

**Build the frontend:**

This project uses a custom frontend, which needs to built. Note: this is done automatically as part of the Docker deployment.

```shell
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run build
```

The build UI files can be found in `frontend/out`

## Running it locally

Start the API / bot manager:

`python src/bot_runner.py --host localhost`

If you'd like to run a custom domain or port:

`python src/bot_runner.py --host somehost --p someport`

➡️ Open the host URL in your browser `http://localhost:7860`

## Improvements to make

- Wait for track_started event to avoid rushed intro
- Show 5 minute timer on the UI
