## Features

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time communication using WebSockets.
- **CORS Middleware**: Allowing cross-origin requests for testing.
- **Dockerized**: Easily deployable using Docker.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- ngrok (for tunneling)
- Telnyx Account

## Installation

1. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Create .env**:
   Copy the example environment file and update with your settings:

   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   ```

4. **Install ngrok**:
   Follow the instructions on the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/download) to download and install ngrok.

## Configure Telnyx TeXML application

1. **Start ngrok**:
   In a new terminal, start ngrok to tunnel the local server:

   ```sh
   ngrok http 8765
   ```

2. **Purchase a number**

   If you haven't already, purchase a number from Telnyx.

   - Log in to the Telnyx developer portal: https://portal.telnyx.com/
   - Buy a number: https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/buy-numbers

3. **Update the Telnyx TeXML applications Webhook**:

   - Go to your TeXML configuration page: https://portal.telnyx.com/#/call-control/texml
   - Create a new TeXML app, if one doesn't exist already:
     - Add an application name
     - Under Webhooks, select POST as the "Voice Method"
     - Select "Custom URL" under Webhook URL Method
     - Enter your ngrok URL in the "Webhook URL" field (e.g. https://your-name.ngrok.io)
     - Click "Create" to save
       Note: You'll see subsequent pages to set up SIP and Outbound, both are not required, so just skip.
   - Navigate to "Manage Numbers" (https://portal.telnyx.com/#/numbers/my-numbers) and under SIP connection, select the pencil icon to edit and select the TeXML application that you just created.

   Now your number is ready to call.

4. **Configure streams.xml**:
   - Copy the template file to create your local version:
     ```sh
     cp templates/streams.xml.template templates/streams.xml
     ```
   - In `templates/streams.xml`, replace `<your server url>` with your ngrok URL (without `https://`)
   - The final URL should look like: `wss://abc123.ngrok.io/ws`. This needs to be the same URL that you added to your TeXML app above.
   - The encoding (`bidirectionalCodec`) should be `PCMU` or `PCMA` depending on your needs. Based on selected encoding, set the outbound_encoding in `server.py` when the bot is initialized. (No changes are required by default.)
   - The inbound encoding can be controlled from the application configuration for inbound calls and dial/transfer commands for outbound calls.

## Running the Application

Choose one of these two methods to run the application:

### Using Python (Option 1)

**Run the FastAPI application**:

```sh
# Make sure youâ€™re in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated
python server.py
```

### Using Docker (Option 2)

1. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```sh
   docker build -t telnyx-chatbot .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -p 8765:8765 telnyx-chatbot
   ```

The server will start on port 8765. Keep this running while you test with Telnyx.

## Usage

To start a call, simply make a call to your configured Telnyx phone number. The webhook URL will direct the call to your FastAPI application, which will handle it accordingly.
