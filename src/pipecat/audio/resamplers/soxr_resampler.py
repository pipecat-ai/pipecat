"""SoX-based audio resampler implementation.

This module provides an audio resampler that uses the SoX resampler library
for very high-quality audio sample rate conversion.

When to use the SOXRAudioResampler:
1. For batch processing of complete audio files
2. When you have all the audio data available at once
