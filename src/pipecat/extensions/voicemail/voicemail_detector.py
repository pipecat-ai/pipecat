"""Voicemail detection module for Pipecat.

This module provides voicemail detection capabilities using parallel pipeline
processing to classify incoming calls as either voicemail messages or live
conversations. It's specifically designed for outbound calling scenarios where
a bot needs to determine if a human answered or if the call went to voicemail.

Note:
    The voicemail module is optimized for text LLMs only.

- References to callback or messaging: "call me back", "I'll get back to you"
