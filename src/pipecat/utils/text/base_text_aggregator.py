"""Base text aggregator interface for Pipecat text processing.

and process text tokens, typically used by TTS services to determine when
aggregated text should be sent for speech synthesis.

    Text aggregators can also be used to manipulate text while it's being
    aggregated (e.g. reasoning blocks can be removed).
