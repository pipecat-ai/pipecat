- Moved interruption wait event from per-processor instance state to `InterruptionFrame` itself. Added `InterruptionFrame.complete()` to signal when the interruption has fully traversed the pipeline. Custom processors that block or consume an `InterruptionFrame` before it reaches the pipeline sink must call `frame.complete()` to avoid stalling `push_interruption_task_frame_and_wait()`. A warning is logged if completion does not happen within 2 seconds.
