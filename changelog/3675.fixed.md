- Fixed WebSocket STT services (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Gladia, Soniox) disconnecting due to idle timeout when no audio is being sent (e.g. when inactive behind a `ServiceSwitcher`). `WebsocketSTTService` now provides opt-in silence-based keepalive via `keepalive_timeout` and `keepalive_interval` parameters.
