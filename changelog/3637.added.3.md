- Added `RequestMetadataFrame` and metadata handling for `ServiceSwitcher` to ensure STT services correctly emit `STTMetadataFrame` when switching between services. Only the active service's metadata is propagated downstream, switching services triggers the newly active service to re-emit its metadata, and proper frame ordering is maintained at startup.
