- `AICFilter` now shares read-only AIC models via a singleton `AICModelManager` in `aic_filter.py`.
  - Multiple filters using the same model path or `(model_id, model_download_dir)` share one loaded model, with reference counting and concurrent load deduplication. 
  - Model file I/O runs off the event loop so the filter does not block.
