- Introducing user mute strategies. User mute strategies indicate when user input should be muted based on the current system state.

  In conversational agents, user mute strategies are used to prevent user input from interrupting bot speech, tool execution, or other critical system operations.

  A list of strategies can be specified; all strategies are evaluated for every frame so that each strategy can maintain its internal state. A user frame is muted if any of the configured strategies indicates it should be muted.

  Available user mute strategies:

  * `FirstSpeechUserMuteStrategy`
  * `MuteUntilFirstBotCompleteUserMuteStrategy`
  * `AlwaysUserMuteStrategy`
  * `FunctionCallUserMuteStrategy`

  User mute strategies replace the legacy `STTMuteFilter` and provide a more flexible and composable approach to muting user input.

  User mute strategies are configured when setting up the `LLMContextAggregatorPair`. For example:

  ```python
  context_aggregator = LLMContextAggregatorPair(
      context,
      user_params=LLMUserAggregatorParams(
          user_mute_strategies=[
              FirstSpeechUserMuteStrategy(),
          ]
      ),
  )
  ```

  In order to use user mute strategies you should update to the new universal `LLMContext` and `LLMContextAggregatorPair`.
