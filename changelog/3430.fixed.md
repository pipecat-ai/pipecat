- Fixed `request_image_frame` (for backwards compatibility) and restored function-call–related fields in `UserImageRequestFrame` and `UserImageRawFrame`, preventing a case where adding a non-LLM message to the context could trigger duplicate LLM inferences (on image arrival and on function-call result), potentially causing an infinite inference loop.
