- Added support for setting up a pipeline task from external files. You can now register custom pipeline task setup files by setting the `PIPECAT_SETUP_FILES` environment variable. This variable should contain a colon-separated list of Python files (e.g. `export PIPECAT_SETUP_FILES="setup1.py:setup.py:..."`). Each file must define a function with the following signature:

  ```python
  async def setup_pipeline_task(task: PipelineTask):
      ...
  ```
