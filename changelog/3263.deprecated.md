- `OpenAILLMContext` and its associated things (context aggregators, etc.) are now deprecated in favor of the universal `LLMContext` and its associated things.

  From the developer's point of view, switching to using `LLMContext` machinery will usually be a matter of going from this:

  ```python
  context = OpenAILLMContext(messages, tools)
  context_aggregator = llm.create_context_aggregator(context)
  ```

  To this:

  ```
  context = LLMContext(messages, tools)
  context_aggregator = LLMContextAggregatorPair(context)
  ```
