- ⚠️ The default `VADParams` `stop_secs` default is changing from `0.8` seconds
  to `0.2` seconds. This change both simplifies the developer experience and
    improves the performance of STT services. With a shorter `stop_secs` value,
    STT services using a local VAD can finalize sooner, resulting in faster
    transcription.

  - `SpeechTimeoutUserTurnStopStrategy`: control how long to wait for
    additional user speech using `user_speech_timeout` (default: 0.6 sec).
  - `TurnAnalyzerUserTurnStopStrategy`: the turn analyzer automatically adjusts
    the user wait time based on the audio input.
