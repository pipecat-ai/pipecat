- Text Aggregation Improvements:

  - **Breaking Change**: `BaseTextAggregator.aggregate()` now returns
    `AsyncIterator[Aggregation]` instead of `Optional[Aggregation]`. This
    enables the aggregator to return multiple results based on the provided
    text.
  - Refactored text aggregators to use inheritance: `SkipTagsAggregator` and
    `PatternPairAggregator` now inherit from `SimpleTextAggregator`, reusing
    the base class's sentence detection logic.
