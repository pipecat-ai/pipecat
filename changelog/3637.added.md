- Added `STTMetadataFrame` to push STT service latency information to downstream processors.
  - STT services now push a frame with P99 time-to-final-segment (`ttfs_p99_latency`) at pipeline start
  - Turn stop strategies automatically configure their STT timeout from this metadata
  - Added measured P99 values: Deepgram (0.39s), Cartesia (0.55s), ElevenLabs Realtime (0.41s)
  - Services without explicit values fall back to a conservative 1.0s with a warning
