- Fixed an issue where if you were using `OpenRouterLLMService` with a Gemini model, it wouldn't handle multiple `"system"` messages as expected (and as we do in `GoogleLLMService`), which is to convert subsequent ones into `"user"` messages. Instead, the latest `"system"` message would overwrite the previous ones.
