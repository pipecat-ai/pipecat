- Fixed a race condition in `SpeechTimeoutUserTurnStopStrategy` where a finalized
  transcript arriving after `user_speech_timeout` elapsed from VAD stop would
  immediately trigger a turn stop, even if the user was still speaking. STT
  processing latency was consuming the `user_speech_timeout` window, leaving no
  time for the user to resume speaking.
