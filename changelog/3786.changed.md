- Word timestamp support has been moved from `WordTTSService` into `TTSService` via a new `supports_word_timestamps` parameter. Services that previously extended `WordTTSService`, `AudioContextWordTTSService`, or `WebsocketWordTTSService` now pass `supports_word_timestamps=True` to their parent `__init__` instead.
