- Added support to Gemini Live (`GeminiLiveLLMService`) for programmatically swapping tools or editing context at runtime; now you can use `LLMMessagesAppendFrame`, `LLMMessagesUpdateFrame`, and `LLMSetToolsFrame` with Gemini Live, like you would with text-to-text services. Importantly, this change enables you to use Gemini Live with Pipecat Flows, if you're using Pipecat Flows 0.0.23 or above. Note that this new functionality only works if you're using `LLMContext` and `LLMContextAggregatorPair` rather than the deprecated `OpenAILLMContext` and associated aggregators.
