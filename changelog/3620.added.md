- Added support to Gemini Live (`GeminiLiveLLMService`) for programmatically swapping tools or editing context at runtime; now you can use `LLMMessagesAppendFrame`, `LLMMessagesUpdateFrame`, `LLMMessagesTransformFrame`, and `LLMSetToolsFrame` with Gemini Live, like you would with text-to-text services. Note that this new functionality only works if you're using `LLMContext` and `LLMContextAggregatorPair` rather than the deprecated `OpenAILLMContext` and associated aggregators.
