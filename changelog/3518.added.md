- Added `TurnCompletionMixin` for LLM services to detect and filter incomplete user turns. When enabled via `filter_incomplete_user_turns` in `LLMUserAggregatorParams`, the LLM outputs a turn completion marker (✓ or ○) at the start of each response. Incomplete turns are suppressed, preventing the bot from responding when the user was cut off mid-thought.
