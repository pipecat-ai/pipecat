- Added `UserIdleController` for detecting user idle state, integrated into `LLMUserAggregator` and `UserTurnProcessor` via optional `user_idle_timeout` parameter. Emits `on_user_turn_idle` event for application-level handling. Deprecated `UserIdleProcessor` in favor of the new compositional approach.
