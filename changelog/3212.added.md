- Added to `AWSNovaSonicLLMService` functionality related to the new (and now
  default) Nova 2 Sonic model (`"amazon.nova-2-sonic-v1:0"`):
  - Added the `endpointing_sensitivity` parameter to control how quickly the
    model decides the user has stopped speaking.
  - Made the assistant-response-trigger hack a no-op. It's only needed for the
    older Nova Sonic model.
