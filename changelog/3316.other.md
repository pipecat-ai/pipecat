- Added `52-live-transcription.py` foundational example demonstrating live transcription and translation from English to Spanish. In this example, the bot is not interruptible: as the user continues speaking, English transcriptions are queued, and the bot continuously translates and speaks each queued sentence in Spanish without being interrupted by new user speech.
