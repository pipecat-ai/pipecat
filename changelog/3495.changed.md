- Improved the STT TTFB (Time To First Byte) measurement, reporting the delay between when the user stops speaking and when the final transcription is received. Note: Unlike traditional TTFB which measures from a discrete request, STT services receive continuous audio input—so we measure from speech end to final transcript, which captures the latency that matters for voice AI applications. In support of this change, added `finalized` field to `TranscriptionFrame` to indicate when a transcript is the final result for an utterance.
