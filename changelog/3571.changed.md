- ⚠️ Changed function call handling to use timeout-based completion instead of immediate callback execution.
  - Function calls that defer their results (e.g., `UserImageRequestFrame`) now use a timeout mechanism
  - The `result_callback` is invoked automatically when the deferred operation completes or after timeout
  - This change affects examples using `UserImageRequestFrame` - the `result_callback` should now be passed to the frame instead of being called immediately
