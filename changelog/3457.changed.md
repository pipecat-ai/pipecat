# Reduce Call Tool Result Context Size by Allowing UTF-8 in JSON Serialization

This PR changes tool result serialization to prevent UTF-8 code points from being escaped during serialization. This drastically reduces the context size when returning a response that contains languages other than English.

We have been running a monkey-patched version in production and it helped us improve the agent accuracy and control cost better.

```
>>> data = { "message": "أهلًا بالعالم" }
>>> json.dumps(data)
'{"message": "\\u0623\\u0647\\u0644\\u064b\\u0627 \\u0628\\u0627\\u0644\\u0639\\u0627\\u0644\\u0645"}'
>>> 
>>> 
>>> 
>>> json.dumps(data, ensure_ascii=False)
'{"message": "أهلًا بالعالم"}'
```
