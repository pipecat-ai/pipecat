- Data and control frames can now be marked as non-interruptible by using the
  `UninterruptibleFrame` mixin. Frames marked as `UninterruptibleFrame` will not
  be interrupted during processing, and any queued frames of this type will be
  retained in the internal queues. This is useful when you need ordered frames
  (data or control) that should not be discarded or cancelled due to
  interruptions.
