- ⚠️ Refactored service settings to use strongly-typed dataclasses (`TTSSettings`, `STTSettings`, `LLMSettings`, and service-specific subclasses) instead of plain dicts. Each service now exposes a `_settings` attribute with discoverable, typed fields. Dict-based `*UpdateSettingsFrame(settings={...})` is deprecated in favor of passing typed settings delta objects. For service maintainers, see changes in COMMUNITY_INTEGRATIONS.md.
