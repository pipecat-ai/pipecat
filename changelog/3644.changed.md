- `AssemblyAISTTService` now automatically configures optimal settings for manual turn detection when `vad_force_turn_endpoint=True`. This sets `end_of_turn_confidence_threshold=1.0` and `max_turn_silence=2000` by default, which disables model-based turn detection and reduces latency by relying on external VAD for turn endpoints. Warnings are logged if conflicting settings are detected.
