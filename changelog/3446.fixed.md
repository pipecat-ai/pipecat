- Fixed an issue where the "bot-llm-text" RTVI event would not fire for realtime (speech-to-speech) services:

  - `AWSNovaSonicLLMService`
  - `GeminiLiveLLMService`
  - `OpenAIRealtimeLLMService`
  - `GrokRealtimeLLMService`

  The issue was that these services weren't pushing `LLMTextFrame`s. Now they do.
