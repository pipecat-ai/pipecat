- Added `UserTurnController` to manage user turns. It emits `on_user_turn_started`, `on_user_turn_stopped`, and `on_user_turn_stop_timeout` events, and can be integrated into processors to detect and handle user turns. `LLMUserAggregator` and `UserTurnProcessor` are implemented using this controller.
