- Added tracking headers (`X-Hume-Client-Name` and `X-Hume-Client-Version`) to all requests made by `HumeTTSService` to the Hume API for better usage tracking and analytics.
- Added `stop()` and `cancel()` cleanup methods to `HumeTTSService` to properly close the HTTP client and prevent resource leaks.
