# Typing is Secondary

When modifying Python code, do not spend an excessive amount of time trying to resolve complex or stubborn typing issues flagged by the linter, especially when dealing with libraries like `argparse` where type inference can be tricky. Prioritize getting the code to a functional state. If the code works as intended, move on.
