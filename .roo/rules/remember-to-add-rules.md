# Remember to Add Rules

When I learn a new, important piece of information about the project's architecture, conventions, or recurring patterns, I must remember to codify it as a new rule in the `.roo/rules/` directory. This ensures that critical knowledge is not lost between sessions and that I can apply it consistently in future tasks.
