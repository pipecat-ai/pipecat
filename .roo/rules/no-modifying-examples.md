# Do Not Modify Example Implementations

When fixing dependencies or resolving issues within the `examples/` directory, I must not modify the source code of the examples themselves (e.g., the `.py` files). The goal is to find a compatible set of dependencies that allows the original example code to run as-is.

If an example is fundamentally broken due to major, unresolvable breaking changes in a core dependency, the correct course of action is to discuss this with the user, rather than to alter the example's logic.
