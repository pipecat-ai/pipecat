# `google-generativeai` Dependency

The `google-generativeai` package is a direct dependency for examples that use the `google.ai.generativelanguage` module. This module is not included in the `pipecat-ai[google]` extras, and therefore `google-generativeai` must be listed explicitly in the `requirements.txt` file for any example that requires it.
