# Testing Dependency Strategies: CI vs. Local Utilities

When deciding how to handle dependencies within a testing or utility script, it is crucial to first understand the script's primary purpose. The choice between using a locally cloned repository (editable install) versus a published package from a registry like PyPI depends on the context.

### Continuous Integration (CI) Environments

*   **Goal:** To catch integration bugs between closely-related projects as early as possible.
*   **Strategy:** Prefer using a **locally cloned repository** (e.g., via `git clone` and `pip install -e`).
*   **Reasoning:** This approach tests against the absolute latest, unreleased code. It ensures that changes in one repository that affect another are discovered immediately, preventing broken dependencies from being published.

### Local Developer Utility Scripts

*   **Goal:** To provide a simple, fast, and reliable tool for developers to run on their local machines (e.g., a one-time import checker).
*   **Strategy:** Prefer installing **stable, published packages** from a registry (e.g., `pip install <package-name>`).
*   **Reasoning:** This approach prioritizes developer experience. It is faster, requires fewer system dependencies (like `git`), and tests the examples against the same public packages that an end-user would use. This makes the test more representative of the user experience and avoids transient failures from development branches.

### Example Application:

The script `test_all_examples.py` was identified as a local developer utility. Therefore, its logic for handling the `pipecat-ai-small-webrtc-prebuilt` dependency was modified to install the package from PyPI instead of requiring a local Git clone. This simplified the script and better aligned it with its intended purpose.
